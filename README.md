# Music Genre Recognition

This project was built to recognize an audio file's musical style with machine learning algorithms. It was trained on the [GTZAN Dataset](http://marsyas.info/downloads/datasets.html) that contains an equal number of 30 seconds tracks for a few predetermined musical styles. 

We used logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, Random forest and Kernel SVM algorithms and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/)/[Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to deploy the project.

## Test it online !

It is accessible online: https://the-mgr-project.herokuapp.com.
For best results, only use 30 seconds .wav audio files. 


## Run it locally

1. Download the repository
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the flask directory: `$ cd users/yourusername/flask`
3. *optional but recommended: activate a virtual environement*
4. Run `$ pip install -r requirements` to install dependencies
5. Run `$ flask run` and follow the link to open Music Genre Recognition in your brower


## Further develpments

While we not actively working on this project anymore, we thought about a few more things to do that would improve it: 

- Restrict file input to .wav files only. Allowing other file types such as .pdf and .csv is confusing
- Add support for .mp3 audio files, which are also common
- Add audio visualization of the chosen file


*Music Genre Regonition is developed by Jason Ola, Andrei Anikin and Melinda Femminis during the semester of spring 2021 for the course "DÃ©veloppement logiciel" given by Davide Picca at the University of Lausanne.*
